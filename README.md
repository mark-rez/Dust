# Dust - Download Manager in Rust
This Rust module allows to download files from the internet and saving them to a specified local path. It uses asynchronous operations to handle downloads and file I/O efficiently.

## Usage
To use this program, you need an internet connection and rust on your system.
I provided an [example script](https://github.com/mark-rez/Dust/blob/main/examples/simple_download.rs) which shows how to use downloading in a script.
